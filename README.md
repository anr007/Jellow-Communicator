[Jellow Communicator](http://www.dsource.in/tool/jellow/) is a friendly Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC)
solution that uses icons to aid communication in people learning to speak or with
difficulty with speech and language.The easy-to-learn interface and visually appealing icons of Jellow make it is an ideal solution for beginner-level communicators.

A novel visual Emotional Language Protocol (ELP) was conceived in order to enhance the language ability of Jellow. ELP represents the 6 core expressive icons of the interface. Using these core buttons along with the central category buttons, the child can very easily communicate their likes, dislikes, and needs with others.

Jellow is developed at the IDC School of Design at the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay located in Mumbai.
